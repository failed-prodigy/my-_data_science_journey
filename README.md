# my_data_science_journey

 Hi, I'm Lakshman! This repo documents my journey to upskill in Python, SQL, Tableau, Machine Learning, and GCP as I prepare for Data Science and Analyst roles.  
 
 ## 🗓️ Daily Journal 
 
 I'll upload code, notes, and mini-projects for each day. 
 This is to track my learning and keep myself accountable.
