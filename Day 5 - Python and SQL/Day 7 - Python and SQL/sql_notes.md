# Day 7 - SQL: UNION & Subqueries

## Topics Covered
- `UNION`, `UNION ALL`
- Subqueries (in `SELECT`, `FROM`, `WHERE`)
- Nested queries and their usage
- Filtering using results from subqueries

## Reflections
Union was helpful in combining datasets. Subqueries were a bit challenging at first, but I understood their value in making queries more dynamic and modular.
