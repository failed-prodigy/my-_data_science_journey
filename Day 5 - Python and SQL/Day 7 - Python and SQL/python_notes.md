# Day 7 - Python: Blackjack Game Project

## Topics Covered
- Functions & loops integration
- List manipulations for card deck
- Random module usage
- Conditionals to handle Blackjack rules

## Reflections
This was a great way to use multiple functions in one program. I got a much better understanding of `while` loops and conditional logic for game mechanics. Fun and educational!
